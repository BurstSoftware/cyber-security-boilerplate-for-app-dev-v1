    Cybersecurity is critical when building applications to protect data, users, and systems from threats. 
    Below are the core concepts of cybersecurity as they apply to application development, with practical implementation tips.

        "Integrity": {
            "description": "Protect data from unauthorized modification or corruption.",
            "implementation": "Use input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS), secure coding practices, and hashing (e.g., SHA-256) for data integrity."

            "description": "Ensure the application and data are accessible when needed.",

            "description": "Verify the identity of users or systems accessing the application.",
            "implementation": "Use strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and secure session management (e.g., short-lived JWT tokens)."

            "description": "Control what authenticated users or systems can do.",

            "description": "Integrate security at every stage of development.",
            "implementation": "Follow OWASP Secure Coding Practices, perform code reviews, and use static/dynamic analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, OWASP ZAP)."

        "Input Validation and Sanitization": {
            "description": "Prevent malicious inputs from compromising the application.",
            "implementation": "Validate and sanitize all user inputs, use parameterized queries for databases, and escape outputs to prevent XSS."

        "Secure APIs": {
            "description": "Protect APIs from unauthorized access or abuse.",
            "implementation": "Use API keys, OAuth, rate limiting, and input validation. Follow OWASP API Security Top 10 guidelines."

            "description": "Keep software and dependencies updated to address vulnerabilities.",
            "implementation": "Regularly update dependencies (e.g., using Dependabot) and apply security patches promptly."
